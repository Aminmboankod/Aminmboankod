# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Amin Mustafa

I am a student of a higher technical degree in web application development in intensive mode.

What does it mean to be an intensive modality?

The intensive modality allows the student to work and train at the same time in any company that wants to be part of the training project.
The company that wants to be part of the intensive training project will enjoy many economic advantages. It also allows me to learn the technologies and methodologies used in the company. In this way, the company can make me the exact profile of the most suitable developer for its team.
